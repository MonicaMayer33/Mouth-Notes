# Welcome to Dental Atlas!
#
# This page will serve as a personal journal and a resource for those passionate about their oral health. 
From exploring different kinds of toothpaste and mouthwash, to sharing my dental school notes.
This is where I will do my best to track new discoveries and uncover misconceptions!
